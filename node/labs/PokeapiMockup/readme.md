# Pokeapi Mockup

I often use the [Pokeapi](http://pokeapi.co) as a demo RESTful web api in trainings.
I like it because it is nicely designed, non-trivial, and - last but not least - fun to use.

However, the Pokeapi is sometimes not available, sometimes slow, and sometimes not
accessible from inside corporate networks. So I decided to build a simple mockup service
that I can use if Pokeapi is not available.
